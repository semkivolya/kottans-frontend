**[x] 0. Git Basics**  

    I liked that lectures are concise and included built-in tests.
    The game that teaches Git was really interesting though I would love it to be less abstract 
    and include some short pieces of code that are stored in example repositories we are working with
    so that I could better understand the purpose behind some git commands I had to execute.
    The Git is a bit overwhelming in comparison to the Mercurial which I used.
