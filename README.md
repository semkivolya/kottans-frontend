## [x] 0. Git Basics  

I liked that lectures are concise and included built-in tests.

The game that teaches Git was really interesting though I would love it to be less abstract 
and include some short pieces of code that are stored in example repositories we are working with
so that I could better understand the purpose behind some git commands I had to execute.

The Git is a bit overwhelming in comparison to the Mercurial which I used.

    </details>

    
    **New:**  Since I am new to linux cli, basically all commands except for cd and mkdir were new to me.   
    **Surprised:** That a command used for moving and renaming files is the same.  
    **Plan to use:** Commands "more and find" seem to be the ones that I will use.  

- HTTP part 1  
    **New:**  The notion of multiplexing(client is able to send multiple requests simultaneously) that was introduced with version 2.0.  
    **Surprised:** Some headers are common for request and response messages. Via header where intermediate proxies or gateways inject their IP or DNS names.  
    **Plan to use:** Tools that allow to monitor HTTP communication, for example: Chrome inspector, Wireshark. 
- HTTP part 2  
    **New:**  Persistent TCP connections that were introduced in HTTP 1.1 that stay open until client closes them and can be reused.  The notion of Fat URLs, Digest Authentication, pool of connections.  
    **Surprised:**  Multiple caching proxies, Cache-control header values.  
    **Plan to use:** Cookies, cache, basic authentication.

    ![Git basics](task_git_collaboration/branching1.png)
    ![Git remote repositories](task_git_collaboration/branching2.png)</details> **New:** Git tags, rebase.  
    **Surprised:** Local main branch is not necessarily directly mapped to the remote main branch. The obsession with keeping commit history clean hence avoiding merge commits.     
    **Plan to use:** Cherry-pick.
- Git and github <details>
    <summary></summary>

    ![](task_git_collaboration/gitgithub.png)</details>

    **New:**  Implementation details of bootstrap grid system. Box-sizing is not inherited. Vertical margins of floated elements do not collapse. And finally I have understood the notion of 'clear' property.  
    **Surprised:**  The exercises are surprisingly good: they make you think and help to better remember information.
